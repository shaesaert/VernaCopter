"""
save_results.py

This module provides functionality to save experiment results, metadata, and 
optional waypoints to organized directories based on the scenario and user mode (automatic or conversational). 

The results include:
- Messages exchanged during the experiment.
- Metadata about the experiment configuration and execution.
- Waypoints generated during the experiment (if available).

The results are saved in unique files within a scenario-specific directory, ensuring that 
each experiment is logged separately.

Functions:
- save_results(pars, messages, task_accomplished, waypoints=None): Saves the experiment data to disk.
- save_messages(experiments_directory, experiment_id, messages): Saves exchanged messages to a JSON file.
- save_metadata(experiments_directory, experiment_id, messages, pars, task_accomplished): Saves experiment metadata to a JSON file.
- save_waypoints(experiments_directory, experiment_id, waypoints): Saves waypoints to a .npy file (if provided).

def save_results(pars, messages, task_accomplished, waypoints=None):
    """
    Saves the results of an experiment, including messages, metadata, and optional waypoints.

    Parameters:
    - pars (object): Contains experiment parameters and settings, including scenario name and user mode.
    - messages (list): List of message objects exchanged during the experiment.
    - task_accomplished (bool): Indicates whether the experiment's task was successfully completed.
    - waypoints (numpy.ndarray, optional): Waypoints generated during the experiment. Defaults to None.

    This function creates an organized directory structure based on the scenario name and user mode
    (automatic or conversational). It sequentially saves the following files:
    - Messages exchanged during the experiment (<experiment_id>_messages.json).
    - Metadata about the experiment (<experiment_id>_METADATA.json).
    - Waypoints generated during the experiment, if available (<experiment_id>_waypoints.npy).

    Returns:
    None
